The project focuses on estimating future sales using predicted sales data. To accomplish this, I utilized essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset contained missing values in key columns like Price, Quantity, and Revenue, which I handled by imputing the missing values using the mean and median of the respective columns. I then performed feature engineering on the Date column by decomposing it into individual time-based components such as day, month, and year. For visual analysis, I used a scatter plot to compare actual vs. predicted sales, helping to evaluate the performance of the model. Finally, I created a tabular comparison of actual and predicted sales using the Pandas library, which provided a clear and interpretable summary of the model's forecasting ability.
